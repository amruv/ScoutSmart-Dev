#Things to implement

Three - dot thingy (option icon) next to the Chats List in the left Menu with Rename & Delete options.
    Rename - Rename window - center of Page with Cancel and Rename button.
    Delete - Delete Window - center of Page with 'Are you Sure?', delete button in red font.

Toggle for light mode and Dark Mode next to Analysis tab button in the top perma banner. If dark, if white background make gray background.

Update chat box similar to gpt with attach symbol, on the left bottom and instead of 'Send' use the send message arrow icon. make it 75% not streching to the whole page.

Need to add backend to get data through this lib https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR.
